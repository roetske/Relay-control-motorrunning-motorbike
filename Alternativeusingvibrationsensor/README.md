# Using vibrationsensor
Test using piezo vibrationsensor to trigger relay on.
The sensor has digital output that you can set vibration level with potentiometer.
Also an analog output when shaken.
I used both to control a relay.
For the analogue output i trigger on a count of a difference on the output of the analogue output.
For the digital output set when shaken it has to be on for a certain time.

Not tested yet on my motorbike or car. Tested it on small dc engine running.
If it works it would be a great alternative to detect motor running
and not using the voltage of the alternator.

The project is a work in progress. I will update working or not.
